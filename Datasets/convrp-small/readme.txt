This set of 3 day Consistent VRP Problems are formatted in TSPLIB format.
These are randomly generated instances where each customer has a probability
of p=0.7 of being visited on each of the 3 days.  

The NODE_COORD_SECTION gives the locations and the distances are Euclidean.
There is a 1 unit service time whenever a customer is visited.  

The DEMAND_SECTION indicates the days that a customer requires service. A
-1 indicates that the customer requires no service on that day.
