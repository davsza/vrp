The instances are extensions of the ConVRP benchmark dataset of GroÃ«r et al. (2009). The modifications to the original dataset only concern the visit frequency. So, the probabilities of a customer to be visited on each of the 5 days were set to p=0.5 and p=0.9, respectively. The instances are structured as follows: The header gives instance parameters like number of customers, planning horizon, vehicle capacity and maximum travel distance. The NODE_COORD_SECTION gives the coordinates for all customers. The DEMAND_SECTION gives the demand of each customer on each day. Service times are listed in the SVC_TIME_SECTION. Finally, the depot coordinates are given in the DEPOT_SECTION.
